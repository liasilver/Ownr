To run: npm start

I successfully set up the Node backend and React frontend, with a backend API using Express. 
Currently, the backend returns an array of users which the frontend fetches and displays. 
As I have not worked with Node, Express or React before I could not get the carousel images to work, however 
the principle should be similar to fetching the array, instead fetching the images.
